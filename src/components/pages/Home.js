          I was introduced to computers at a young age and I was immediately
          fascinated. I somehow managed to get my hands on a Commodore 64 and
          spent countless hours trying to figure out dos commands and make my
          first programs. However life never runs in a straight line. I went to
          work in retail at age 20 and just never left. I love working with a
          team and helping others to progress. I had the opportunity to travel
          for work which allowed me to work with a diverse range of people. Some
          22 years later, and with a bit of relief, I decided it was time and
          left the company. I joined the KU Full-stack Bootcamp, and although
          the experience was challenging, it was awesome. Iâ€™ve learned how much
          I enjoy coding and the process and challenges.
